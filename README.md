# STOCK-MARKET-ANALYSIS
The objective of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The model utilizes past stock prices to predict the next day's closing price. The stock data is scaled, and a deep learning model using LSTM layers is trained on this data.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
tensorflow
yfinance
scikit-learn
You can install these dependencies using pip:

Usage
To run the model and predict stock prices, follow these steps:

Load and preprocess data:

The historical stock data is fetched from Yahoo Finance for the specified company (in this case, Google).
Stock prices are scaled to a range of 0 to 1 using MinMaxScaler.
Train the model:

The LSTM model is trained on the last 60 days of stock price data to predict the next day's closing price.
The model uses three LSTM layers, with Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Test and evaluate:

The model is evaluated on unseen data, and predictions are made.
A plot is generated showing actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Modify company ticker:

If you want to predict stock prices for a different company, simply change the company variable in the code:
python

Model Architecture
The LSTM model is composed of:

LSTM Layers: The model has three stacked LSTM layers with 50 units each to capture temporal dependencies in stock price data.
Dropout Layers: Dropout layers with a dropout rate of 20% are added to prevent overfitting.
Dense Layer: A final dense layer with a single neuron is used to predict the next day's stock price.


Here's a sample README.md file that you can use for your GitHub repository for the stock price prediction code:

Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This repository contains a Python implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for predicting stock prices. The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on historical stock price data fetched using yFinance.
